# Configuration files

## TODO
- bashrc more readable, purpose of some things lost
- vimrc more structured, plugins in same place, interface in some other maybe file
- script to init new system with these configuration files, vim requires some instalations e.g. nodejs for coc.nvim
- get rid of keyboard layout commands
